I have fixed and completed the push for all files 
removed the branch MASTER as it was not necessary and kept all files on MAIN branch

Also, I have uploaded the README to confirm the submission

I did make a mistake as I though I was uploading the README for the other task (which was the incorrect file) 

Any changes on this README file are now reflecting the correct location for the files 

Task is completed "git-task"
